## Introduction
House price prediction is a common problem in real estate, where accurate estimates are essential for buyers, sellers, and investors. This project uses the Boston Housing dataset to train models that predict house prices using different machine learning algorithms.

## Approaches

### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. It models the relationship between the dependent variable (house prices) and independent variables (features).

### Decision Trees
Decision Trees are a non-linear supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They split the data into subsets based on the value of input features.

### Random Forests
Random Forests are an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing dataset, which contains information about houses in the Boston area, including features like the number of rooms, crime rate, and property tax rate.
